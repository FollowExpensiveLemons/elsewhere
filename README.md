# Campus Exploration Manual (CEM)

Hello! This document has been compiled, updated, maintained and converted to latex like god intended by students just like you who are looking to expand their experience on campus. This guide should give you fairly detailed info on how to get most anywhere on campus. Ever wondered where to spend a few hours late on a weeknight? Weâ€™ve got you covered!

This Repo serves to allow students to add discoveries, or updates to the manual. People can feel free to submit pull requests, and I will add them to the repo if they seem meaningful. 

The original document (AFAIK) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q972Q3hmqaev8_tXNAqe6GsHFPM3YeOoKFOR8Ohykbk/edit#heading=h.26uuhfmusvel), but it has not been updated recently.
